// Booleans
// The "true" printed in the previous slide is called a boolean.
// There are only two boolean values; true and false. Conditional statements evaluate to "true" when the condition is met and "false" when it does not. You can see how this works in the examples below.

// Booleans and if Statements
// In the previous slide, we learned that conditional statements will result in a boolean value. Based on this knowledge, you will be able to understand that the if statement's code runs when the conditional statement is true and does not run when it is false.
// Below, check the flow for when the statement's conditional is true.

// Comparing Greater and Lesser Values
// The > symbol that was used in the conditional statement is a comparison operator which compares the size of values.
// For a < b, when a is less than b the statement will be true, but false when it is greater than b. Also, for a <= b, when a is less than or equal to b, the statement will be true, like the symbol ≦ used in mathematics.
// Enough information!
// Now let's get to work.
