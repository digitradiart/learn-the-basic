/*
push
The push method is used to add a new value to an array.
Put the new value you want to add to an array in () right after the word push. The example below adds the value 4 to the end of the numbers array by passing it as an argument to the push method.

*/const characters = ["Ken the Ninja", "Ben the Baby Ninja", "Master Wooly"];

console.log(characters);

// Add the string "Birdie" to the characters array with the push method
characters.push("Birdie");

// Print the characters array
console.log(characters);
