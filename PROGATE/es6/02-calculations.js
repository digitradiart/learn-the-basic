// You can use integers (numbers) in programming too. Unlike strings, you don't need to use quotes for integers. Integers are used to do calculations like addition and subtraction. Use + for addition and - for subtraction.

// Like the example below, console.log(5 + 2); will print out the result of the addition, which is 7. On the other hand, when you put 5 + 2 in quotes, it will be printed as a string.
// Remember that strings and integers are different!

// Output the result of 5 plus 3
console.log(5+3);

// Output the result of 20 minus 8
console.log(20-8);

// Output the string "4 + 5"
console.log("4+5");


// Multiplication and Division
// Let's learn other calculations besides addition and subtraction!
// As you can see below, asterisks (*) are used for multiplication and forward slashes (/) are used for division. These symbols are different from those used in ordinary math so be sure to remember them!

// Remainders
// Also, you can use the percentage symbol (%) to get the remainder after dividing two numbers. This is useful because there are many ways to use remainders in programming!

// Output the result of 8 times 4
console.log(8*4);

// Output the result of 24 divided by 4
console.log(24/4);

// Output the remainder after dividing 7 by 2
console.log(7%2);
