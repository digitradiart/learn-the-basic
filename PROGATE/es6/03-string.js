// Combining Strings
// The + symbol can also be used to combine (or "concatenate") strings. As shown below, "Ken" + " the Ninja" is printed as a string Ken the Ninja.

// Differences between Strings and Integers
// Let's look at an example of the difference between strings and integers.
// "3" + "5" will become the string "35", but 3+5 will become 8.
// This is why it's important to remember that strings and integers are completely different!

// Output the combination of "Master " and "White"
console.log("Master" + "White");

// Output the combination of "20" and "15" (as a single string)
console.log("20"+"15");
