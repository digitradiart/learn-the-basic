Creating Objects Efficiently
Objects, like the one we created earlier, are commonly used when creating websites. For example, a web service that requires login, like Progate, use objects for user data. Because creating this data from scratch every time is inefficient, you'll next learn how to create similar data easily.

Object Blueprints
In order to create objects efficiently, it's useful to make a "blueprint". For example, when creating data for multiple users, the data can be created based on a pre-prepared "user blueprint".

Classes
The blueprint mentioned in the previous slide is called a class in JavaScript. By writing class ClassName, as shown below, new classes can be created. Class names usually start with an uppercase letter.

Creating Instances
Since we have already prepared an object blueprint, let's try actually creating objects from the blueprint. To create an object from a class, write new className(), as shown below. Objects created from classes are called instances. An instance from the "Animal" class is called an "Animal instance".

Checking Instances

Here, let's print the Animal instance created from the Animal class in the console to confirm that the instance is an empty object as shown below. Don't worry about the class name "Animal" printed before the {} brackets.
