// A function is a set of instructions. As shown below, the introduce function has two operations, Greeting and Say name.
// Let's learn how to write functions in the next slide.

// To make a function, you need to define it. To define a function, writefunction() and then write what you want the function to do inside the {} (curly brackets). We'll learn more about function definitions later.

// Calling Functions
// // // // Function definitions are necessary, but you have to call a function to actually use it. To call the function in the example below, just write introduce();. You can see how it works by writing your own code in the exercise.

const greet = function() {
    console.log("Hello!");
    console.log("Let's study functions!");
  };
  
  // Call the function here
  greet();
