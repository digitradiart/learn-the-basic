// Assigning Functions
// Let's take a closer look at functions. In the function definition below, the code inside the orange border is the function itself. We define functions by assigning them to a constant.
// In the exercise, let's try to write a function definition and then call it.

// Assign a function to the hello constant
const hello = function() {
    console.log("Hello!");
    console.log("I am digitradiart");
  }
  
// Call the function assigned to the hello constant
hello();
