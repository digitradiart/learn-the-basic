// JavaScript (abbreviated as JS) is a scripting language that is a staple of web development. Today, almost all websites use JS.
// The ES2015 (ES6), which we'll learn in this lesson, is the new version of JS that is attracting attention in recent years for enabling people to write code more efficiently.

console.log("Welcome to ES6 Study I!");
console.log("Let's learn with Ken the Ninja!");


// Now let's learn how to write original JS code! console.log() prints out the letters that are typed inside the parentheses.
// We call text characters, like Hello World, strings. As you can see below, you must use single or double quotation marks.

// Semicolons
// Each statement should end with a semicolon (;). In most cases, the code will function normally even without ending semicolons, but it's good practice to include them for clarity.

// Writing // at the start of a line makes it a comment. This means it will be ignored when the code runs. This is called commenting out code.
// These comments are used to leave notes and explain the code when necessary.

// Output "Hello World" to the console
console.log('Hello World');

// Output "Ken the Ninja" to the console
console.log('Ken the Ninja');

// Comment out the line below
// console.log("This line should be a comment");
