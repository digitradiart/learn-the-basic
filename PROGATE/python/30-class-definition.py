# To make objects for the menu items, we first need to prepare a blueprint. Blueprints are known as classes, and their objects are called instances. Make sure to remember these terms!

# The process to creating an instance can be seen below. We'll start from Step 1: Prepare a Class and continue from there.
# Let's first prepare the class (blueprint). A class can be defined using class ClassName:. Class names, by convention, always begin with a capital letter as shown with the MenuItem class

# The contents of the class (or blueprint instructions) are written starting the next line under class MenuItem: and must be indented. Since we still don't need to add anything yet, we'll write pass (which we use when we have no code to execute) as shown on the right. 

# Define the MenuItem class
class MenuItem:
    pass
